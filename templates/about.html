            <h1 class="uk-heading-primary">About</h1>

            <h2 class="uk-heading-bullet">Me</h2>

            <p>
                I am currently a student at the University of Waikato, studying towards a Bachelor of Computing
                and Mathematical Sciences (Hons). I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence, computer
                networks and communications, and compiler theory/construction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whilst studying I have maintained grades in the A range and have worked on a variety of personal
                side projects which can be viewed on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/u/JedS6391" target="_blank">GitLab</a> account.
                One of my favourite projects was a website I created to provide an alternative, and more reliable interface
                for searching <a href="https://www.reddit.com" target="_blank">reddit</a>, which can be found
                <a href="https://reddit-slider-search.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Computing</h3>

            <p>
                I am confident using a variety of different technologies, but my language of choice is Python which I have
                been using for ~4 years. This site was even created using Python and the excellent Flask framework -
                feel free to <a href="https://gitlab.com/JedS6391/portfolio-jed-simson" target="_blank">view the source</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                A complete list of technologies I am comfortable with can be found within my CV, but here is a brief list of my most
                frequently used languages/frameworks/etc:
            </p>

            <dl class="uk-description-list">
                <dt><b>Languages</b></dt>
                <dd>Python, Java, Swift, C#, Haskell, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Assembly</dd>
                <dt><b>Frameworks</b></dt>
                <dd>Flask, Django, Android, React, Bootstrap, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, AWS</dd>
                <dt><b>SQL/NoSQL Database Technologies</b></dt>
                <dd>MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis</dd>
                <dt><b>Version Control</b></dt>
                <dd>Git, GitHub, GitLab</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
                I am constantly learning new languages and frameworks as I believe it all helps me to become
                a better programmer, as I learn new ways to approach solving various problems and I can come to
                an informed decision about what technology may be best for the problem I am faced with.
            </p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
                I am a passionate musician, having studied Jazz Performance for a year at the University of Auckland
                in 2014. I love to create interesting music which could be described as a mix of genres such as Jazz,
                Progressive Rock, Alternative, Electronic and a whole lot more! Some of my music is available on my
                <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jed-simson" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> account.
                I'm always interested in collaborations too!
