            <h2 class="uk-heading-bullet">Me</h2>

            <p>
                I am currently a Junior Software Developer at <a href="https://www.vista.co" target="_blank">Vista Entertainment Solutions</a> 
                where I work primarily with a .NET stack, alongside SQL Server, Angular and TypeScript.
                Each day brings forward new problems to test my problem solving abilities &mdash; one of the key factors behind my interest in software development and computer science in general.
            </p>

            <p>
                Applying the knowledge gained during completion of a Bachelor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (Hons) degree from the University of Waikato, I strive to achieve a high quality of work in all my professional and personal pursuits.
                A subset of my personal projects can be found on either my <a href="https://gitlab.com/u/JedS6391" target="_blank">GitLab</a> or <a href="https://github.com/JedS6391" target="_blank">GitHub</a> accounts.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am passionate about technology &mdash; with a particular interest in artificial intelligence, computer networks, and compiler theory/construction.
                I aim to stay informed regarding the state-of-the-art techniques so that I can leverage them in my work; for example, I am always looking for novel techniques to add to my <a href="https://github.com/JedS6391/LGP" target="_blank">open-source Linear Genetic Programming system</a> (view the accompanying thesis <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/thesis/Open-Source Linear Genetic Programming.pdf') }}">here</a>).
            </p>

            <p>
                On the side, I play an array of different instruments and enjoy creating music in all sorts of styles which I can share with the world.
            </p>

            <h3>Computing</h3>

            <p>
                I am confident using a variety of different technologies, but my language of choice is Python which I have
                been using for ~4 years. This site was even created using Python and the excellent Flask framework &mdash;
                feel free to <a href="https://gitlab.com/JedS6391/portfolio-jed-simson" target="_blank">view the source</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                An exhaustive list of technologies I am comfortable with can be found within my CV, but here is a subset of my most
                frequently used languages/frameworks/etc:
            </p>

            <dl class="uk-description-list">
                <dt><b>Languages</b></dt>
                <dd>Python, Java, Kotlin, Swift, C#, Haskell, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Assembly, C</dd>
                <dt><b>Frameworks</b></dt>
                <dd>Flask, Django, Android, React, Bootstrap, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, .NET</dd>
                <dt><b>Databases</b></dt>
                <dd>MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis</dd>
                <dt><b>Version Control</b></dt>
                <dd>Git, Subversion, GitHub, GitLab, Team Foundation Server</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
                Learning new languages, frameworks, and other technologies is important to me, as I believe it all
                contributes to me becoming a better developer &mdash; particularly by showing me new approaches to
                solving problems and helping me create informed decisions regarding technology choice.
            </p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
                I consider myself to be a passionate musician, having studied Jazz Performance for a year at the University of Auckland
                in 2014. I love to create interesting music which could be described as a mix of genres such as Jazz,
                Progressive Rock, Alternative, Ambient, and a whole lot more! Some of my music is available on my
                <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jed-simson" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> account.
