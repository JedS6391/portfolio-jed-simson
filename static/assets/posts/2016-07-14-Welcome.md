This is my personal portfolio and blog site - my own little section of the Internet!

I probably won't post a whole lot, but I may occasionally post my thoughts on my studies, personal projects, or some music reviews.

For now, I will simply leave a few links to some songs I've been enjoying lately - enjoy!
